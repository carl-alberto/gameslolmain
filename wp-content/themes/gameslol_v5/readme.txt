Manage and display your user reviews anywhere on your site to quickly and organically jump to the top of SERP rankings.

== Description ==

Did you know that 63% of customers are more likely to make an online purchase from a site that displays user reviews? The Rich Reviews plugin empowers you to easily gather user reviews for your business, website, or individual products/pages and display them anywhere on your WordPress site. These rating reviews, called rich snippets, have become a main focus to Google in ranking individual pages in SERPs, and Rich Reviews makes sure they are readable visible.

= Rich Reviews in a nutshell: =
* **Share** your company’s value through positive customer reviews.
* **Attain** the top rankings in SERPs by overshadowing your competition with rich snippets.
* **Attract** the most qualified customers to your site, and gain their trust.



= What’s the big deal about rich snippets? =
The Rich Reviews plugin does the work for you to make it possible for your ratings/reviews to be showcased as rich snippets in SERPs. In case you were wondering what rich snippets look like, look at the example in the screenshots tab.

Here are some benefits of using Rich Reviews to show off your rich snippets:

*	They are a visual way to show your business’ value and worth by displaying products, prices, reviews/rankings, contact information, and important links.
*	Current businesses with rich snippets have seen a 10%-30% CTR increase.
*	Users have correct expectations before browsing your site, which also means a decrease in bounce rates.
*	You will stand out amongst your competition.
*	Higher rankings in SERPs.
*	An increase in website traffic, as well as more qualified traffic.

Rich Reviews Plugin Features:

*	Gives you the control to use and customize three types of reviews: per-page/per-post, category, or global reviews - whether you want users to review products, categories, or your entire website.
*	Moderated submissions - allows you to choose which reviews are added to your site.
*	Built completely around shortcodes, allowing you to include any of the three key features on any page, post, sidebar, footer, or widget on your site.
*	Simple design means compatibility across themes and flexible CSS
*	Endless color options for star and numerical rating systems.
*	Includes external stylesheet for ease of customization.
*	Minimalist, lightweight, and efficient code so your users won’t notice any hiccups.
*	Integrates with user accounts and gravatar images.
*	Displayed in microdata format following Schema.org (Google Rich Snippets) protocol so that site ratings are shown in SERPs with Google Rich Snippets (which increases overall rankings).
*	Plugin doesn’t slow down website.
*	Available for translation.
*	Support for any questions.

== Installation ==

1. You can download and install the Rich Reviews plugin through the built-in Wordpress plugin installer. Alternately, download the zip file and upload the '/rich-reviews/' folder to your '../wp-content/plugins/' folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. View the instructions page in your the Wordpress backend to see detailed explanations and examples of how and where to use the shortcodes which enable reviews to be shown, submitted, or averaged.
4. Periodically check the Rich Reviews menu in the Wordpress control panel to see if there are any pending reviews which need to be approved (or deleted).

== Screenshots ==

1. This is an example of what a rich snippet returned in both organically and by paid advertising will look like in an SERP.
2. Show any number of reviews for your whole site, for a specific page or post, or for any custom category. Display these reviews in any post, page, sidebar, or widget!
3. A simple shortcode allows you to post an aggregate review score on any page.
4. A simple and clean review submission form can be placed anywhere on your site, and will not bog down your site.
5. Admin menus allow you to approve the submitted reviews, so YOU control what reviews are real, and which reviews are unwarranted (or even spam). You can also view every review you have already approved, and choose to push it back to a "pending" status, or even delete it.
6. Added options allow for you to customize the star color to match your site.
7. One user shows the versatility of Rich Reviews by placing our shortcodes into various tabs on one of his pages.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.6.0 =
We updated the "rich snippets" of this plugin to use microdata instead of microformat - microdata is the new hotness and works much better with search engines. This is a big change for us, as the way we rendered meta data had remained the same for the last couple years, and slowly started to lose its applicability. We hope that this change will give greater compatibility between the metadata/rich snippet markup and search result summaries.

= 1.3 =
This adds the MUCH requested feature of having per-page/per-product reviews, as well as adding optional categories for further customization! The instructions page has also been overhauled to provide useful, relevant explanations and examples for each of the shortcodes.

= 1.2 =
This version is essential, as it fixes a bug where the MySQL database was not created unless the plugin had been installed at version 1.0

= 1.1 =
This version pretties up the reviews and the form, and fixes the CSS to allow vertical stacking of reviews in, say, a sidebar. Also implements an "approved reviews" menu to view and change the status of previously-approved reviews.

= 1.0 =
Initial release
